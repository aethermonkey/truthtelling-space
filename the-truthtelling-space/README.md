# The Truth Telling Space

A minimal static site using Bulma, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Project Strategy

This project is intentionally simple, focusing on fundamental web technologies:
- **HTML** for structure
- **JavaScript** for interactivity
- **Bulma** for modern, responsive CSS styling (via npm)
- **npm** for dependency management and running a local static server

No frameworks (like React or Vite) are used. This approach ensures maximum transparency, ease of contribution, and minimal build complexity.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```zsh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```zsh
   npm start
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Folder Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `main.js` – Main JavaScript file
- `node_modules/` – Installed dependencies (Bulma, http-server)
- `package.json` – Project metadata and scripts

## Customization

- Edit `index.html` and `main.js` to build your site.
- Use Bulma classes for styling: [Bulma Documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/)
